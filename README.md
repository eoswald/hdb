hdb
===
hdb (Hillbilly Debugger) is an easy to use C/C++ debugger that works by printing out each line of code as it's being executed. This project was created in 24 hours at HackRPI so yeah, it's probably a little buggy. Currently you need Go (https://golang.org/) to run it.

To install:

```
git clone https://github.com/eoswald/hdb.git
go install
```

To run:

```
./hdb myprogram.cpp
```
